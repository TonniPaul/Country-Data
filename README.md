## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - TypeScript 


### What I learned

- I learnt How to use state In TypeScript.
- How do make use of the "useParam" hook to route from mapped item 
- How to make use of the "useNavigate" hook to navigate to previous page

### Continued development

I intend to continue building more projects using typescript.


### Useful resources

- [How to Route from mapped list](https://app.pluralsight.com/guides/react-router-typescript) - This helped me with understanding how to route with react from a mapped list with using the useParam Hook.
